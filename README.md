# Chatbot - ITIC

This chatbot was built during my summer internship in 2016 at the IT Innovation Centre in the University of Birmingham.
It assists students in solving thier hardware or software issues. You can find the project [here](http://itinnovation-chatbot-helpdesk.mybluemix.net/)

In order to run it locally you need to create IBM Bluemix account and add the credentials to the app.
This can be done using this helper git repos:

  * [https://github.com/biosopher/watson-ipa-web-nodejs/wiki] (https://github.com/biosopher/watson-ipa-web-nodejs/wiki)
  
Then run: 
  * npm install
  * node app.js
